I am a software engineer working with TypeScript, Python and Rust.

Some of the bigger projects I worked on:

- [**@GrafeasGroup**](https://github.com/GrafeasGroup): GrafeasGroup is a non-profit organization that aims to improve internet accessibility. I am helping to develop and maintain our database, API and network of six bots.
- [**GameFeeder/GameFeeder**](https://github.com/GameFeeder/GameFeeder): A notification bot for Game updates, available for Discord and Telegram. One of my first bigger programming projects, serving over 7000 combined users.
- [**stonefish_engine**](https://github.com/TimJentzsch/stonefish_engine): An amateur chess engine implementing the UCI protocol. This was my first bigger project in Rust.
- [**DioxusLabs/taffy**](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy): An implementation of the Flexbox specification in Rust, which is used by @DioxusLab and @Bevy. Here I mostly help with project management and code quality improvements.
