I am a software engineer working with TypeScript, Python and Rust.

Some of the bigger projects I worked on:

- [**bevyengine/bevy**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy): A data-driven game engine in Rust. I am helping with issue triaging, plugin development and optimizing the CI pipelines.
- [**@GrafeasGroup**](https://github.com/GrafeasGroup): GrafeasGroup was a non-profit organization aiming to improve internet accessibility. I helped to develop and maintain our database, API and network of six bots.
- [**GameFeeder/GameFeeder**](https://github.com/GameFeeder/GameFeeder): A notification bot for Game updates, available for Discord and Telegram. One of my first bigger programming projects, serving over 7000 combined users.
- [**stonefish_engine**](https://github.com/TimJentzsch/stonefish_engine): An amateur chess engine implementing the UCI protocol. This was my first bigger project in Rust.
